DAY 8 EXERCISE 2: Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it
is a prime number or not.

e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

Hint
Remember the modulus:

Make sure you name your function/parameters the same as when it's called on
the last line of code.

Use the same wording as the Example Outputs to make sure the tests pass.
